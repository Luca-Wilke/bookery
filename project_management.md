# Project management workflow

A mixture of SCRUM and KANBAN is used in order to provide a scaleable and easy to handle project workflow.

1. Requirement analysis
   
   - write down purpose of application
   
   - define key features
   
   - define extra features
   
   - define optional features
   
   - define target group
   
   - define outstanding elements

2. Product backlog document
   
   - write down features to be added
   
   - evaluate the most important features

3. Sprint document
   
   - add the most important product backlog features to the sprint document
   
   - divide these features into little subfeatures
   
   - plan implementation

4. Update KANBAN board
   
   - move backlog entries to sprint entries

5. Sprint phase
   
   - each day write a short day document containing the daily aim and thoughts on the project (may not take longer than 5 to 10 minutes)
   
   - work off the subfeatures in order 
   
   - update KANBAN board each time a subfeature is finished

6. Testing and fixing phase
   
   - test the features in order
   
   - update KANBAN board eatch time a subfeatures has been tested

7. Building and deployment
   
   - build the application and update the github repository

8. Restart from step 2
   
   - eventually add new features to the backlog document
